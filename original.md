# N. ZARICH * SD76 NOTES

## Types

* tells the compiler or the runtime a plan for your memory layout
* built in type
  * e.g. double, int, string
    * lots of these
    * these may or may not have other capabilities
      * what does it mean to have a capability / feature / functionality?
        * remember string.length() * something a type can do
* user defined type * something like a structure (struct) or an class that you define
  * defines (NOT DECLARE) a memory layout
  * may or may not define capabilities associated with the memory layout
    * what does it mean to have a "capability?"
      * for user defined classes, you can also define your own capabilites
        * in a class, we refer to capabilites as 'methods'

* defining classes and structures are ways for the coder to create a "type"

* struct vs class
  * generally you can use these terms interchangably
    * example in c++ *> members are private by default in class, but not in structs
      * have subtle differences based on your language

* Operand
  * an instance of type that is 'operated on'
  * can be a built in type or a user defined type

* Operators
  * operates on the operand
  * when you have a Type, you will need to perform operations on it
      * eg int + int * in this case the '+' symbol
  * operators have prescidence
  * https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_operators.htm

  * MEMORIZE * Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment
  * learn general prescidence 
      1 + 2 * 3 
  * may or may not be able to operate on different types of operands 

  * cast 
    * could be considered a type of operator 
    * convert or view a type as though it is a different type 

    * in ANSI C, a cast to integer looks like ...
       (int)242.32; 

       std::static_cast<int>(242.32);













 ## TODO

* Declaration vs Definition

* Stack 
* Function 
    * 
* Getter
* Setter
* Method * a function (capability) that is attached to a specific class 

* Class * The recipe for how the memory is layed out and the associated functionality as a bundle 
  * Member

* Object 
* Instance
* Overload
* Fields
* Properties
* Constructors
  * default
  * overloaded
* Methods
* private / public access
* dot access 
* enum


        // 1 * Access modifier
        // 2 * Type
        // 3 * Name
        // 4 * Getters and Setters

        // 1     2     3        4
        public string Make { get; set; }

* compiler 
* runtime 

* redundancy 
* inheritance

* garbage collection 
* virtual memory
